Titanic Data Preprocessing 🚢

This repository contains a ipynb file for data preprocessing on the Titanic dataset, typically used in machine learning tasks such as survival prediction. The notebook demonstrates essential steps in cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning dataset containing passenger details such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status. The goal of preprocessing is to:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical features

Normalize/standardize numerical features

Create engineered features

Prepare the dataset for machine learning models

Features

Data loading and exploration

Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Label encoding & one-hot encoding

Feature engineering (e.g., Family size, Title extraction)

Scaling numerical variables

Final cleaned dataset ready for ML training

TASK 2
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, trends, anomalies, and feature relationships using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
